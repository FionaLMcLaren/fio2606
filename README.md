# How to work with Fiona
Hi! I'm Fiona. I use pronouns she/her. Here is a user manual for working with me.

## The best ways to get in touch with me

**Ping Slack's /#support-engineering chat**
I am interning in the support engineering team and I am sure that my team members will have some good insight on what I’m working on and be able to give you some answers about my project or what I’m doing

**Message me on Slack!**
As a fully remote intern, I will be on Slack most of the time and will try to get back to you as soon as I can, give or take with how booked up I am with meetings and what not!

**Organise pair-programming**
I find that pair programming is the best way for me to solve any engineering-related problems as I can see what is happening and get stuck into the problem. I feel like I am a visual learner so having the code on the screen via screen sharing over explanations on Slack works so much better for me!

## Conditions I like to work in

**Seeing over Hearing**
When it comes to coding issues, I would rather see the actual code so I get some insight on the environment and also how the code is being laid out. I find having code explained to me without it being on screen quite difficult to visualise and therefore I can struggle more to find what could be going wrong.

**I like interaction and affirmation** 
I think I like putting my ideas out there with others so I can know if they are worth dwelling over. Also, I feel like it is a good chance to hear what others have to say and hearing these opinions help me know if I am on the right track or not. I also love hearing other people’s ideas so I can consider things that I never thought of before and I can learn new things.

## How I like to give/receive feedback

**Frequent Feedback**
Having more feedback than less works good for me as it means I know if I am following the path I set out before correctly and also affirms to me that the work I am doing is meaningful!

**Hearing about the Impact**
If I have done something that has made a meaningful impact, such as streamlining a process so it is quicker or helping to make someone’s life a little easier, I would love to hear about it! It makes me proud when I know that other people have benefitted from what I’ve been done and motivates me to do my best work.

## Things I need

**A Listening Ear**
I am the type of person who will quickfire questions so having someone there that can point me in the right direction really helps. Even if you do not know the answer to what I am asking, acknowledgement is also nice too as I sometimes can feel like I can be pestering people with all the help I might need! 

**Routine**
I am someone who would rather have more in my agenda than run the risk of running out of things to do. I am eager to jump on to try new problems that might come up. I like setting out goals on what I have to do and making checklists as I feel like this keeps me accountable and helps me do the work I need to do.

​​## Topics I’m always happy to talk about

**Pets!**
I love hearing about other people’s critters and talking about my own little dog, Shellie! I find their quirks and personality so endearing and it really brightens my day hearing what someone’s pet has been up to!
